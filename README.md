### Installation

Just clone and build it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aleen42/sound.js.git
```

Install npm dependencies:

```bash
cd sound.js && npm i --no-save
```

Run the application locally:

```bash
npm run sound
```

The command above will try to load songs of the path: `assets/songs/` via command `npm run task:load`, after which a file named `songList.json` will be created in the assets folder. Then, the command will also create a local server via `npm run task:server`. By default, the application can be accessed by `http://localhost:9000`.

### Usage

If you want to load songs locally, you can just paste files with a `.mp3` format into the folder: `assets/songs/`. After that, remember to run `npm run sound` again to build this project.

*Notice that: this project is temporarily supported MP3 files, and any file without a extension name `.mp3` will not be loaded.*

#### Optional

If you don't want to use `assets/songs`, you can just override the variable `base` array in the file `load.js`, to specify where to scan mp3 files recursively.

```javascript
const base = [
    './assets/songs/',
    /** wrong pointer which will cause resources missing error */
    './../music',
    /** make a soft link like using `ln -s ./../music ./assets/music` */
    './assets/music/'
];
```

*Notice that: because a resource outside a server root is invisible, so if you are using Linux/Mac OS, remember to make a soft link to a path, which is under the root of this project, or this project will have broken down with a relative path like `./../music/`. If you are using Windows OS, I'm very sorry to say that, you have to copy your directory into this project, so that it can be loaded.*
